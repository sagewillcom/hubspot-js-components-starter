# HubSpot JS components starter
You have 2 directories in the root of this repository:

1. `js-blocks`
2. `theme`

They are completely separate from each other and can live in separate repositories. In a production environment, I'd recommend separating them to avoid any conflicts with configurations.

**Please note:** This repository is mostly for learning about HubSpot JS blocks and code reference.
We cannot guarantee that things will actually work in production or during a build.

## JS blocks
The `js-blocks` directory contains all the React components necessary to make a full CMS theme in HubSpot, including meta information, module fields, custom styling, and configurations.

[Learn more in the js-blocks README.](js-blocks/README.md)

## Theme
The `theme` directory includes a standard HubSpot CMS theme setup with a particular way of handling sections and templates. All modules are in the `js-blocks` directory so you won't find any here.
